METHODOLOGY
===========

The model of the Nandi bull was created by simply walking around the object and taking pictures with a Nikon D5100.
These were then imported into photoscan and aligned without masking (this could be done to improve the model and
maybe done at a later date). 

The dense point cloud was then generated and edited for cruft. Mesh was then generated and holes closed, texture 
applied and the model exported for use on Sketchfab and wherever else. All of these processes were done at medium
settings.
